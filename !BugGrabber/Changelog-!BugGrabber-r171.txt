Oops the chat link stuff wasn't supposed to go in until next major version, but nevermind - streamlined it a bit now.

* Clean out unused locales and sort keys alphabetically so we mirror the wowace l10n system
* Store locals in its own property on the error object so that it's easier to separate for a potential display
* Only compare session errors when scanning for duplicates
* If it has been more than 30 seconds since the last error and no display addon is detected, print a new message saying that a bug has been detected

* Allow BugGrabber to be embedded, although it's not something I recommend. If more than one instance of BugGrabber tries to load up, only the first one will prevail; there's no versioning. If a standalone !BugGrabber addon exists, it will always be preferred.
* Has not been tested while running alongside an embedded copy; hopefully Archarodim will test fully.
* Change some strings to use the default system color because it's nicer. I forgot to make it update according to the users configured system color, but will do so at a later point. Also deleted some unused localization strings.
* Added a load.xml file that can be referenced in the TOC of a parent addon for embedding purposes.
